									<p>Preptitude is a brain child of seasoned MBA prep professionals working on various aspects of enabling students achieve their MBA dreams. </p><p>

We believe that real MBA entrance exam preparation, whether it is GMAT, GRE or the executive assessment,  should add significant value to an MBA  applicant and  should be more than learning a  handful of  "gimmicks"  or trying to get around the exams using " shortcuts". These scores are not merely numbers that you fill in your online application, these exams help students build important higher order reasoning skills that are essential in their MBA and Management programs. 
</p>
									<p>Conventional Test Prep companies have evolved little in the last 10 years, whereas the evolution of Technology has had a profound impact on the core skills that are tested on these exams. Think of the multiple ways in which touch screens, auto correct, speech to text, spell check grammar check to text and predictive text have altered the way you think, read, analyze and write. Conventional test preparation companies which focus on teaching for as many exams as possible from the same old material and based on the same old methodology have lost relevancesince access to material is the easiest thing today. Practically any book that you desire to have is available on the Internet (free or paid for).</p><p>

We believe that the big box test preparation, packing in 10 to 15 students in a classroom and offering proprietary material built around tricks and shortcuts, is not the best mode of preparation. Every year vast majority of the students enrolled in these programs offering “quick fixes” don't really take the exam,because the class they enrolled into had students at different levels of aptitude and the instructors are left trying to cater to the lowest common denominator in the class. Since the trainers  were given a certain content to cover in each class, chances of customization are minimal.
</p>
									<p>A lack of customized approach implies that most test prep companies follow what we call " SPRAY and PRAY", which means they teach you hundreds of formulas, dozens of grammar rules, and countless shortcuts and they hope that some of them will stick with you when you take your exam. While this might work for some students, whose scores you will see scrolling on their websites, these students would have had a high score even otherwise. A majority of the students spendseveral months going through these books trying to memorize the so-called shortcuts and eventually either give up on their aspirations or settle for a score far lower than their caliber.</p><p>
We believe effectively preparing students requires an intuitive understanding of the student mindset,the practical difficulties students face during the processandthe importance of the student time .All of our programs are built keeping in mind the unique challenges that the today’s MBA Aspirant faces.That is the reason our programs include significant personal mentoring ,that goes far beyond teaching prescribed content and allows customization, and are taught online, to save time.</p><p>

At PREPTITUDE, we restrict the class size to a maximum of 4 and strive to bring in students at the same aptitude level into a class. Our Program, orientation and the subsequent one on one sessions that the students have, is customized to give students feedback and ensure that students are not just attending classes but are really benefiting out of them.
