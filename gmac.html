<br>
During the Executive assessment, you will be evaluated on the higher-order reasoning in three sections:<br>
Integrated Reasoning, <br>
Verbal Reasoning<br>
Quantitative Reasoning. <br>

The scoring scale for each section of the assessment is 0 to 20.<br>
The total Score ranges from 100 to 200 All three sections are equally weighted in determining your total score.<br>

        <div class="panel-body"> While we broadly agree with the reasons given above for taking the executive assessment And believe that the executive assessment is a GREAT  alternative for students who do not have the time to prepare for the GRE or the GMAT, there are some important points that students taking executive assessment ( even the GMAC if they are listening )need to be aware of: 

</p>

<div class="container">
 <!-- <h2>• The Issue Task - Present Your Perspective on an Issue.</h2>-->
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-info collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo127">The level of preparation 
  </button>
  <div id="demo127" class="collapse">
   <div class="panel-body">
<p>
While the executive assessment claims that it only requires modest preparation, our view is different, A significant amount of time and effort goes into familiarizing yourself with the different question types and figuring out how to solve these questions in the time that is provided. 
 </p></div>
  </div>
</div><br> 	

<div class="container">
 <!-- <h2>• The Issue Task - Present Your Perspective on an Issue.</h2>-->
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-info collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo125">Number of Retakes
  </button>
  <div id="demo125" class="collapse"><div class="panel-body">
 <p> 

You can (at present) take the executive assessment only Twice in a lifetime, as opposed to  5 times in a year for Gmat (with a lifetime limit of 8 attempts). This is a significant problem since we have you known students who take the exam going by the modest preparation advice on the website and are left with only one attempt to get the score that the program asks for. 

</p>
  </div></div>
</div><br>

<div class="container">
 <!-- <h2>• The Issue Task - Present Your Perspective on an Issue.</h2>-->
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-info collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo128">The score range
  </button>
  <div id="demo128" class="collapse"><div class="panel-body">
 <p> 

Theoretically, The scoring given out by the executive assessment should range between 100 and 200, but practically all the students we have seen have a total score that confirms to the formula 120 plus  the scores received on the three subsections i.e.  if you receive a quant score of 7, an integrated reasoning score of 10 and a verbal score of 12 your total score will be 120+7+10+12 = 149. 

So the score range of 100 and 200, and the practical score range of 120  to 180 are confusing, to say the least. 

</p>
  </div></div>

    <div class="container">

  </button>
  <div id="demo129" class="collapse"><div class="panel-body">
 <p> 

one of the problems that students taking executive assessment need to grapple with is that (as on date) there are no percentiles given along with the executive assessment score, making it difficult both for the schools and the students to compare themselves and evaluate their chances. 
</p>
  </div></div>

  </button>
  <div id="demo12" class="collapse">
   <div class="panel-body">
<p>
While  the GMAC  has said that the executive assessment will test concepts similar to the GMAT, it has not published any official material or practice tests, making it really difficult for students to have an estimate of how they will score on an official test

 <p> 


There are no brakes during the 90 minute duration of the executive assessment, that can cause significant fatigue as you solve the sections, we have had students who came to house after the first attempt and told us the main challenge they faced during the exam was to give the concentration levels during the Math section which happens to be the last section.

 <p> 
Measurement does not give you choice to select the section you want to answer first, this has been a constant complaint with people taking the GMAT and at least while designing a new exam this feedback should be kept in mind and the student should have been allowed to answer the section they are most comfortable first.

While the number of schools accepting executive assessment as a measure replacing the GMAT has gone up since the executive assessment was launched in 2016, there are still a number programs that might require you to take the GMAT. So before you decide to take the executive assessment please be sure that you have evaluated all the executive programs that you could go to and have narrowed down on the programs that require the executive assessment.

2.Because it was designed for busy professionals, the assessment includes just three short 30-minute sections with a total of 40 questions.
3.The assessment focuses on the skills that are critical both to work and in an EMBA program: higher order reasoning, critical thinking, analysis, and problem-solving.
4.The assessment requires a modest level of preparation.                     A lot of students would beg to differ, so do we. The executive assessment requires a fair degree of preparation.  
5.The assessment will help you (or your program) identify the skills you most need to sharpen in order to be successful in an EMBA program.
6.You can reschedule your assessment as many times as you’d like, with no additional fees (as long as it’s at least 24 hours before your appointment).
7.Taking the assessment is a convenient alternative to meet your application requirements.
8.GMAC worked with top business schools to custom-build the assessment.
9.The assessment provides an objective confirmation of the caliber of students in your cohort.
10.You can take the assessment year-round at over 600 conveniently located test centers.

 <p>
The Executive Assessment is as much about the attitude as about the Aptitude, in fact, we believe all the fundamental aptitude skills tested on the Executive Assessment can be acquired with practice. The ATTITUDE is the difficult part. We focus on the attitude as much as the aptitude in the classes and the test reviews is where this comes to light even more clearly. 

Once you start taking your practice tests, you and your instructor will analyze the tests in a 1 on 1 test review and come up with the agenda for the next few days before you do another test. Repeating this over the 3 exams helps you arrive at the optimum approach to your exam.

So we have structured the preparation in a way that doesn't Hinder any of the Other commitments you have. 
We have divided the exam preparation process into 3 modules as follows 

We recommend that you keep the three stages as contiguous as possible but the program has been built accounting for discontinuities that are part of most test takers schedules.

  <div id="demo18" class="collapse"><p>

Let us first address the most important constraint, a lot of students fear that they will not be able to maintain a personal connect with the trainer who they have not met in person, and even with improved Technology, it is true that some of the chemistry of tutoring will not be as easily created online. This is a trade-off that needs to be weighted against the Advantages. Given that most corporate training and university courses also are offered online, this is a hurdle that you might have crossed before or might want to cross.

  <div id="demo19" class="collapse">
 <p>Most senior executives are continually on the move around the world,making them miss out on classes and leaving them with discontinuities in preparation. 

A lot of students stay nowhere close to places where the classes are held and the others who do stay close still have to spend a significant amount of time making it to the class, time that can be more effectively utilized preparing. 

Apart from this, conventional test preparation companies can only have classes at a certain time (like weekends or late evening classes)that might or might not fit your schedule. 

With online training, you can work around these problems.

Many  students have apprehensions about their superiors at work knowing about their MBA  ambitions. It's also not a great idea to share your GMAT aspirations with everyone around, it can lead to a lot of social pressure especially if you are taking some time to crack the exam. Online preparation helps students keep their MBA ambitions under the wraps till you want to disclose it.

Since the software allows for desktop sharing, a whiteboard, and records the classes, the students need not take notes. The video of the class you attended is available for you to go back to whenever you want to revise concepts, much better revision method compared to looking at concept videos that you're not part of or looking at notes that you made but can't understand. 

We will run you through the features of the technology in the first class.
