        <div class="panel-body"> The scoring on the GMAT is a little complex and you need to spend time to understand this. <br>

Official GMAT score card will contain 5 different components <br>
1 Analytical writing assessment  (AWA)<br>

The analytical writing assessment on the GMAT  is scored on a scale of 0 to 6.<br>

2 Integrated reasoning section (IR)<br>
Integrated reasoning section is scored on a scale of  1 to 8. <br>

3 Quantitative reasoning <br>
The quantitative reasoning section is scored on a theoretical scale of 0-60 but practically 	the scores range from 10 to 51. A score of 51 is the 99th percentile.<br>

4 Verbal reasoning <br>
The verbal reasoning section is scored on a theoretical scale of 0 to 60 but practically the 	scores range from 9 to 46,. A score of 46 is the 99th percentile <br>

It's important to note that the scores on the quantitative and verbal sections are not the 	same as the number of questions you got correct. <br>

So ignore the raw scores and focus on the percentiles, that makes the understanding the 	section easier.<br>

5 The total score on the exam.<br>
The score is calculated by combining your quantitative and verbal percentile and ranges 	between 200 and 800. The  AWA  and IR scores are not considered while calculating 	the overall score.<br>

 <p>The GMAT is as much about the attitude as about the Aptitude, in fact all the fundamental aptitude skills tested on the GMAT can be acquired with practice. The ATTITUDE is the difficult part, The GMAT uses psychometric analysis and behavioral patterns to make it very difficult for most exam takers to crack the GMAT. We focus on the attitude as much as the aptitude in the classes and the test reviews is where this comes to light even more clearly. 


 </p>

<p>Once you start taking your practice tests, you and your instructor will analyze the tests in a 1 on 1 test review and come up with the agenda for the next few days before you take another test. 
 </p>
<p>Repeating this over the 6 exams helps you arrive at the optimum approach to your GMAT. Our experience shows that a proper test taking strategy on the GMAT can help you add up to 100 points to your GMAT score.    </p>

  <div id="demo13" class="collapse"><p>We know many people would tell you to take a diagnostic test before you start preparing for the exam. We suggest you do a practice test, but after a thorough run through of the concepts. A diagnostic test without the knowledge of the test, its content, and its scoring methodology is only going to hurt your prep.Given that you have had a significant time away from tests of any kind, you will also struggle to sit through the whole exam with full concentration.



A GMAT diagnostic test score is helpful to test prep companies to show you an illusion of improvement on your exam.

 <p>
Many test prep companies, unable to find or afford instructors who are GMAT experts, hire math and English subject matter experts to teach their GMAT courses.These guys, although great at their subjects, lack a fundamental understanding of the exam.
Anyone who has not takenThe GMAT under test conditions can hardly relate to the time and fatigue constraints that the GMAT can put you through.
As we said earlier, this test is not about subject knowledge,its about aptitude and attitude.

The GMAT is one of the most over-hyped exams in the world, which makes our jobs look super important. This also leads to loads of material being generated. If you start going through all that material, you might have to enroll for an MBA a few years later than you planned to.
The first material you should be solving is the official guide for the GMAT. You have enough official material to cover even after that.

Even with improved Technology, it is true that the chemistry of tutoring will not be as easily created online. This is a trade-off that needs to be weighted against the Advantages. Given that most corporate training and university courses also are offered online, this is a hurdle that you might have crossed before or might want to cross.

Students with a 640 to 680 score range, who are rejected out of the top 20 schools without an interview call, generally get in after they improve their GMAT scores by 50 to 100 points.

A student admitted to Richard Ivey, one of the top schools in Canada, with a score of 640 increased his GMAT score to a 690.The admission committee offered him an additional $25,000 in scholarship. 

In another instance, a student who was waitlisted at London Business School got into the program after she managed to raise her GMAT score.
