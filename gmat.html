            <div class="acc-content">
                 The scoring on the GMAT is a little complex and you need to spend time to understand this. <br>

                Official GMAT score card will contain 5 different components <br>
                1 Analytical writing assessment  (AWA)<br>

                The analytical writing assessment on the GMAT  is scored on a scale of 0 to 6.<br>

                2 Integrated reasoning section (IR)<br>
                Integrated reasoning section is scored on a scale of  1 to 8. <br>

                3 Quantitative reasoning <br>
                The quantitative reasoning section is scored on a theoretical scale of 0-60 but practically     the scores range from 10 to 51. A score of 51 is the 99th percentile.<br>

                4 Verbal reasoning <br>
                The verbal reasoning section is scored on a theoretical scale of 0 to 60 but practically the    scores range from 9 to 46,. A score of 46 is the 99th percentile <br>

                It's important to note that the scores on the quantitative and verbal sections are not the  same as the number of questions you got correct. <br>

                So ignore the raw scores and focus on the percentiles, that makes the understanding the     section easier.<br>

                5 The total score on the exam.<br>
                The score is calculated by combining your quantitative and verbal percentile and ranges     between 200 and 800. The  AWA  and IR scores are not considered while calculating   the overall score.<br>

                                <p>The quantitative and verbal sections of the GMAT use a computer algorithm based on the principle of adaptive testing. Each section starts off with questions of average difficulty and based on the responses given by the student the exam makes the questions either more difficult or easy.The exam repeats this process till the end of the section to get an estimate of the student's competence levels. </p>

                                We don't have our GMAT question bank because we don't have our version of a GMAT. The GMAC has already released the following material and we believe it is more than enough if you solve some of it. 

List of GMAT material from the GMAT prep:
<ol>
  <li>The official Guide for the GMAT. </li>
  <li>The Quantitative review for the GMAT.</li>
  <li>The Verbal Review for the GMAT.</li>
  <li>The GMAT prep question pack.</li>

</ol>
In addition, you also have access to about 2500 questions from GMAT prep, the earlier official guides, and the old GMAT  paper-pencil tests.

                                <p>The GMAT is as much about the attitude as about the Aptitude, in fact all the fundamental aptitude skills tested on the GMAT can be acquired with practice. The ATTITUDE is the difficult part, The GMAT uses psychometric analysis and behavioral patterns to make it very difficult for most exam takers to crack the GMAT. We focus on the attitude as much as the aptitude in the classes and the test reviews is where this comes to light even more clearly. 
                                </p>

                                <p>Once you start taking your practice tests, you and your instructor will analyze the tests in a 1 on 1 test review and come up with the agenda for the next few days before you take another test. 
                                 </p>
                                <p>Repeating this over the 6 exams helps you arrive at the optimum approach to your GMAT. Our experience shows that a proper test taking strategy on the GMAT can help you add up to 100 points to your GMAT score.    </p>

                                <p>We know many people would tell you to take a diagnostic test before you start preparing for the exam. We suggest you do a practice test, but after a thorough run through of the concepts. A diagnostic test without the knowledge of the test, its content, and its scoring methodology is only going to hurt your prep.Given that you have had a significant time away from tests of any kind, you will also struggle to sit through the whole exam with full concentration.



                                A GMAT diagnostic test score is helpful to test prep companies to show you an illusion of improvement on your exam.

                                <p>Many test prep companies, unable to find or afford instructors who are GMAT experts, hire math and English subject matter experts to teach their GMAT courses.These guys, although great at their subjects, lack a fundamental understanding of the exam.
                                Anyone who has not takenThe GMAT under test conditions can hardly relate to the time and fatigue constraints that the GMAT can put you through.
                                As we said earlier, this test is not about subject knowledge,its about aptitude and attitude.

                                <p>Let us first address the most important constraint.A lot of students doubt that they will not be able to maintain a personal connect with a trainer who they have not met in person.
                                Even with improved Technology, it is true that the chemistry of tutoring will not be as easily created online. This is a trade-off that needs to be weighted against the Advantages. Given that most corporate training and university courses also are offered online, this is a hurdle that you might have crossed before or might want to cross.

The software allows for desktop sharing, a whiteboard, and records the classes,so taking notes is optional.The video of the class you attended is available for you to go back to whenever you want to revise concepts. A much better revision method compared to looking at concept videos that you're not part of or looking at notes that you made but are not comprehensive. 

                                We will run you through the features of the technology before classes commence. </p>

                                <p>It's not just about getting any score on the GMAT, it is about getting the best score possible. The GMAT score does not just determine what colleges you get into and what colleges you can't get into, it also determines scholarships and aid that you receive as a student. A good test program can help you raise your GMAT score by 50 to 100 points, increasing your chances of getting into top B-schools and Receiving scholarships. 

                                Students with a 640 to 680 score range, who are rejected out of the top 20 schools without an interview call, generally get in after they improve their GMAT scores by 50 to 100 points.

                                A student admitted to Richard Ivey, one of the top schools in Canada, with a score of 640 increased his GMAT score to a 690.The admission committee offered him an additional $25,000 in scholarship. 

                                In another instance, a student who was waitlisted at London Business School got into the program after she managed to raise her GMAT score. 

                                There are hundreds of other examples where a higher GMAT score has helped students get into a school that they wouldn't otherwise get into or receive a significant aid or scholarship.
