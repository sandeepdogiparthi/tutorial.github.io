  <div id="demo8" class="collapse"><p>Reading comprehension on the GRE consists of a passage of up to 350 words, followed by a cluster of at least two questions that pertain to that passage. These questions frequently require students to summarize the author’s main point, strengthen or weaken an argument made in the passage, or identify what must be true based on the facts presented.</p><P>
Reading Comprehension questions fall into three distinct categories
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Multiple-Choice (select one answer choice) - students must select the one correct answer choice from among the five provided.
</li>
    <li>Multiple-Choice (select one or more answer choices) - students must select at least one correct answer choice from among the three answer choices provided; no credit is given for incomplete or partially incorrect answers.</li>
    <li> Text Selection – students must highlight the portion of the passage that meets the description provided.</li>
    <li> Each of these question categories tests the ability to read, absorb, and analyze written information.</li>

  <div id="demo9" class="collapse">
 <p>These questions consist of a short passage that contains one, two, or three blanks; each blank represents a word or short phrase that is missing from the passage. Students must select exactly one correct answer choice from among the three to five provided for each blank.  A student does not receive credit for a Text Completion question unless he or she selects the correct answer choice for every blank in the passage.</p><p>
Students must use contextual clues within the passage to determine which answer choice contains the word or words that most logically complete each blank. This question category tests the ability to recognize an author’s overall meaning or tone from the syntax of the written material. Success on these questions requires an understanding of the subtle shades of meaning that differentiate similar words.

Students must select the two answer choices from among the six provided that both (1) fit coherently into the sentence, and (2) produce sentences that are equivalent in meaning.

 <p>The GRE is as much about the attitude as about the Aptitude, in fact all the fundamental aptitude skills tested on the GRE can be acquired with practice. The ATTITUDE is the difficult part, The GRE uses psychometric analysis and behavioral patterns to make it very difficult for most exam takers to crack the GRE   We focus on the attitude as much as the aptitude in the classes and the test reviews is where this comes to light even more clearly. </p>

<p>Once you start taking your practice tests, you and your instructor will analyze the tests in a 1 on 1 test review and come up with the agenda for the next few days before you take another test. </p>
<p>Repeating this over 6 exams helps you arrive at the optimum approach to your GRE   Our experience shows that a proper testing strategy on the GRE can help you add up to 15 points to your GRE score.</p>

  <div id="demo13" class="collapse"><p>We know many people would tell you to take a diagnostic test before you start preparing for the exam. We suggest you do a practice test, but after a thorough run through of the concepts. A diagnostic test without the knowledge of the test, its content, and its scoring methodology is only going to hurt your prep.Given that you have had a significant time away from tests of any kind, you will also struggle to sit through the whole exam with full concentration.



A GRE diagnostic test score is helpful to test prep companies to show you an illusion of improvement on your exam.

 <p>Many test prep companies, unable to find or afford instructors who are GRE experts, hire math and English subject matter experts to teach their GRE courses.These guys, although great at their subjects, lack a fundamental understanding of the exam.
Anyone who has not takenThe GRE under test conditions can hardly relate to the time and fatigue constraints that the GRE can put you through.

  <div id="demo18" class="collapse"><p>Let us first address the most important constraint. A lot of students doubt that they will not be able to maintain a personal connect with a trainer who they have not met in person.
Even with improved Technology, it is true that the chemistry of tutoring will not be as easily created online. This is a trade-off that needs to be weighted against the Advantages. Given that most corporate training and university courses also are offered online, this is a hurdle that you might have crossed before or might want to cross.
